            <p id="what_we_do"data-aos="fade-up">We create industry-defining transactions by aligning brand and white space opportunities with buyers that drive growth by accelerating brand awareness and consumer adoption. Our firm originated as a buy-side advisory, giving us a unique knowledge of the industry’s most important buyers and how their investment committees make decisions. 
            <br><br>Today, we leverage these insights for the benefit of founder-led premium and luxury adult beverages that are building a new brand and category. We never cast a wide net for buyers; we are laser-focused on those with the right capabilities for each brand, and we transact clients exclusively with strategic buyers that actively use M&A to address white space opportunities and create significant profit pools.

            <p id="our_founder"data-aos="fade-up">Jeff Menashe, founder and CEO of Demeter Advisory and co-founder and chairman of Demeter & Co., has more than 27 years of investment banking and corporate development experience in adult beverages. He has completed more premium adult beverage M&A transactions with enterprise values above $50 million than any other investment banker in the United States. To date, Menashe has advised on total transactions approaching $4 billion He also actively invests in adult beverage brands with global potential, including Bertoux Brandy and Isle of Arran Distillers.<br><br>

                Menashe’s interest in consumer brands and collaborating with founders began early, influenced by his father, an owner-operator in the consumer space. For Menashe, client relationships are about the journey rather than the transaction. He begins working with founders early in the process of building their company, typically spending four to five years helping them guide the brand in a direction that creates value and prepares founders for the ultimate exit.
